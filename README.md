# Astronomical Objects Website
This project is about a one page site where is well organized information about the objects in space. At the point this README was written it just had the planets in the solar system including the sun and the actual solar system. It is planned to keep adding objects as time passes.

## Motivation
The motivation for this projects was two things. One; this project was part of an intesive class where I had to display my skills learned the term right before the intensives. Second; there is a really big problem when anyone want to learn about some specific object about the universe. Numerous places where you can go to and almost no place where you can find them organized. This is why I self-assigned the task of creating a product where you can learn about astronomical objects of the universe and have them accessible in a handy way.

## Aproach to built code
In the aproach of building this code I implemented different codes I have worked in the past. I took from a personal portfolio project pretty much the whole desing.

To have the hability to display on the screen a lot of articles I also use from another project the layout for the javascript file and json files. 

### HTML 
For the HTML file I use lots of div elements. I learn the ability to use divs to manipulate where to display the content in the webpage. At first it was hard to keep up with the naming of each div element in past projects but for this one it was a little bit more easy. Still don't know if there is a better way.

### CSS
For the CSS file I point to most of the div elements by id. I would like to learn a better efficient way is there is one but for this project it was long but still practical.

### Javascipt
Still not the language that I preffer but this project allow me to have a better comprenhention with how to make elements in Javascript give it an atribute and also assing some kind of information extracted from a json file.
